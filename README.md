The Docker Playground is an initiative aiming to provide instructions for building Docker environments to give training and practice environments for educational purposes.

# Sections

* [Docker -> Getting Started](https://github.com/spartaglobal/Docker_Playground/tree/master/Databases)
* [Environments -> Various docker environments to help train and educate](https://github.com/spartaglobal/Docker_Playground/tree/master/Environments)

## Environment Sections

Within the [Environments](https://github.com/spartaglobal/Docker_Playground/tree/master/Environments) section will be various folders relating to particular activities which will be listed under the master folder of that section. As an example the Database section will have a file describing what is available.

Each subsequent folder per master environment will have instructions on how to utilise the particular environment for training purposes and give direction to some useful resources to help practice.
